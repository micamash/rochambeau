## Overview

### The challenge from The Odin Project

This challenge was from The Odin Project. The first challenge was to build the logic for the game with JavaScript that was playable through the browser console. The second challenge integrated what I learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript query selectors to create a GUI.

## My process

First, I created the logic for the game itself and made sure it was correct and playable through the console. After I verified it was working correctly, I created the HTML and styled the page with CSS. After I completed that I returned to my JavaScript and added some functions and selectors to complete the project.

### Built with

-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned more about manipulating the DOM and got more practice with JavaScript during this exercise.

### Continued development

I plan to continue practicing JavaScript.
