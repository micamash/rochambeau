## Overview

### The challenge from The Odin Project

"We’re going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text."

## My process

First, I created the logic for the game itself. After I verified the logic in the console, I created the HTML and styled the page with CSS. After I completed that I returned to my Javascript and added some functions and selectors to complete the project.

### Built with

-HTML
-CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned more about manipulating the DOM and got more practice with JavaScript during this exercise.

### Continued development

I plan to continue practicing JavaScript.
